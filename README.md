# 🚍 UJ Smart Transit System (UJSTS)

## Project Overview

This is a proof-of-concept for a modern, digital solution designed to transform the antiquated University of Johannesburg (UJ) bus system—currently managed via static PDFs and outdated processes—into a dynamic, user-friendly smart transit application.

The goal is to provide UJ students and staff with a reliable, real-time, and seamless campus commuting experience, bridging the gap between old data methods and modern mobile utility.

## Impressive Features (Planned)

The app is being developed in phases to implement the following features:

| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Schedule View** | A filterable, real-time schedule view showing routes between all campuses (APB, DFC, SWC, APK). | **IN PROGRESS (Phase 1)** |
| **Real-Time Bus Tracking** | Displaying the live GPS location of operational shuttles on an interactive map. | **TO DO (Phase 2)** |
| **Virtual Queue & Booking** | Ability to join a virtual queue and book a seat for high-demand routes. | **TO DO (Phase 3)** |
| **Real-Time Alerts** | Sending push notifications for delays, unexpected cancellations, or route changes. | **TO DO (Phase 2)** |
| **Digital Cancellation** | Simple interface for users to cancel virtual queue reservations. | **TO DO (Phase 3)** |

## Current Status (Phase 1)

We are currently setting up the application's foundational structure using Angular and focusing on building the core Schedule Viewer component.

## Technologies Used

* Angular (for structure and reactivity)
* TypeScript (for robust, typed code)
* Tailwind CSS (for a modern, responsive UI)
* GitHub (Version Control)
* *(Future additions: Firebase/Firestore for real-time data, Google Maps API for tracking)*
